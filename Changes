Revision history for Net-SMTP-TLS

0.10    Dec 28th, 2005
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
	Lots of stuff that could be done for future versions, such as better
	tests, and better documentation.
0.11	Jan 5th, 2006
	POD tests are a nuisance, removed. Also, per Michal Ludwig's
	suggestion, TLS is not forced, but is now turned on/off by a flag.
